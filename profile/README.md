# Patternity

**Patternity** is a research-driven organization focused on building open protocols
for proving the uniqueness of behavior in interactive systems.

We explore how value can emerge from **process and behavior**, rather than from
ownership, outcomes, or randomness.

## Core Idea

In digital systems, behavior is usually ephemeral.
Patternity treats behavior as a **first-class, provable signal**.

Our work is based on the idea that:

> **The way an agent acts over time can be a unique and valuable digital asset.**

---

## Proof-of-Game

Patternity is the creator of **Proof-of-Game (PoG)** — a protocol for proving
the uniqueness of an agent’s behavior over time inside an interactive system.

In the context of the protocol:

```

Game = Agent × Time × Rules × Actions

```

Proof-of-Game evaluates **how actions are performed**, not whether they lead to
success, rewards, or optimal outcomes.

## Repositories

- **proof-of-game**  
  Protocol specification, event contracts, and mint eligibility model.

Additional SDKs, validator nodes, and reference implementations will be added
incrementally.

---

## Project Status

- Proof-of-Game v1: Specification in progress
- Reference implementations: Experimental
- Validator network: Early research stage

Patternity is currently focused on protocol design and validation,
not on consumer-facing products.
