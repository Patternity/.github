# Patternity

**Patternity** is a research-driven organization focused on building open protocols
for proving the uniqueness of behavior in interactive systems.

We explore how value can emerge from **process and behavior**, rather than from
ownership, outcomes, or randomness.

## Core Idea

In digital systems, behavior is usually ephemeral.
Patternity treats behavior as a **first-class, provable signal**.

Our work is based on the idea that:

> **The way an agent acts over time can be a unique and valuable digital asset.**

---

## Proof-of-Game

Patternity is the creator of **Proof-of-Game (PoG)** — a protocol for proving
the uniqueness of an agent’s behavior over time inside an interactive system.

In the context of the protocol:

```

Game = Agent × Time × Rules × Actions

```

Proof-of-Game evaluates **how actions are performed**, not whether they lead to
success, rewards, or optimal outcomes.

## Shared Context and Governance

This repository uses shared organizational context and governance rules
provided by the Patternity meta repository.

The following documents are authoritative and MUST be consulted
before making changes or architectural decisions:

- `.meta/AI_GUIDE.md` — AI usage rules and constraints
- `.meta/CONTEXT.md` — organizational and project context
- `.meta/STYLE.md` — documentation and terminology standards
- `.meta/VERSIONING.md` — versioning and immutability rules

These documents take precedence over informal discussion or chat history.

## Repositories

- **proof-of-game**  
  Protocol specification, event contracts, and mint eligibility model.

Additional SDKs, validator nodes, and reference implementations will be added
incrementally.

---

## Project Status

- Proof-of-Game v1: Specification in progress
- Reference implementations: Experimental
- Validator network: Early research stage

Patternity is currently focused on protocol design and validation,
not on consumer-facing products.
